# electrotv
A TV shows tracker app build with React and Electron. I called it ElectroTV because I'm that creative. In order to use it you will need to get an API key from thetvdb.com (can't share mine, sorry). Fortunately, [this is very easy](https://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=apiregister).

Install
=====

```bash
THETVDB_API_KEY=<KEY> yarn install && yarn start
```
